## Rules of the game

The game is designed for two players, the winner is determined at the moment when one of the players scores 100 points.

With each roll of the dice, the player receives temporary points equivalent to the number on the die.

After that, the player has 2 options for further play, roll the die again, or skip a move.

If the player decides to roll the die again, and the number 1 falls out, all the player's temporary points disappear, and the turn goes to the next player.

If a player decides to skip a turn, all his time points are recorded in his main score, and the turn goes to the next player.

Have a good game.
